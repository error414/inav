# OpenFC Lite 30x30

Open hardware flight controller by OpenDrone, 30.5 x 30.5 mm mounting, 3S-8S.
Hardware files: https://github.com/OpenDrone-hw/OpenFC-Lite

INAV target: `OPENFC_LITE`

> The target has not been flown yet. Check the IMU orientation on the bench
> (Setup tab: nose down, roll right, yaw) before the first arming.

## Hardware

* MCU: RP2354B (RP2350B, QFN-80, 2 MB flash in the package), 12 MHz crystal
* IMU: BMI270 on SPI. The footprint also takes an ICM-426xx, which is detected as well
* No barometer and no compass on board, I2C pads for external ones
* 4 motor outputs (DSHOT), no servo outputs
* 10 V rail for the VTX, switchable
* Beeper pad, status LED, LED strip pad
* ADC: battery voltage, current signal from the ESC connector, RSSI, one spare pad
* microSD socket and analog OSD: not supported by INAV yet, see below

## Pinout

| GPIO | INAV name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 0 / 1 | PA0 / PA1 | UART1 TX / RX, digital VTX connector |
| 2 / 3 | PA2 / PA3 | UART3 TX / RX |
| 4, 5, 6 | | analog OSD, not used |
| 7 | PA7 | Beeper |
| 11 | PA11 | 10 V VTX rail enable (PINIO1) |
| 12 | PA12 | Status LED |
| 13 | | IMU interrupt, not used |
| 14 | PA14 | IMU chip select |
| 15 | | IMU CLKIN, not used |
| 16 / 17 | PB0 / PB1 | I2C SDA / SCL |
| 18 / 19 / 20 | PB2 / PB3 / PB4 | IMU SPI SCK / MOSI / MISO |
| 22 / 21 | PB6 / PB5 | UART2 TX / RX, receiver pads |
| 23 | PB7 | LED strip |
| 26 / 27 | PB10 / PB11 | UART4 TX / RX, RX is also the telemetry pin of the ESC connector |
| 31, 30, 29, 28 | PB15, PB14, PB13, PB12 | Motors M1, M2, M3, M4 |
| 40 | PC8 | ADC: current |
| 41 | PC9 | ADC: battery voltage |
| 45 | PC13 | ADC: RSSI |
| 47 | PC15 | ADC: spare pad |
| 42, 43, 44, 46 | | microSD, not used |

## Serial ports

| Port | Silk | Hardware | Default function |
|---|---|---|---|
| USB | USB-C | USB VCP | MSP |
| UART1 | TX0 / RX0, VTX connector | uart0 | MSP DisplayPort (HD OSD) |
| UART2 | TX1 / RX1 | uart1 | Serial receiver, CRSF |
| UART3 | TP0 / RP0 | PIO | GPS (enable the GPS feature) |
| UART4 | TP1 / RP1, ESC connector | PIO | ESC telemetry |

UART3 and UART4 are software (PIO) UARTs. None of the ports can work in
single-wire half-duplex mode, so SmartPort, FPort and similar protocols are
not available. Inverted signals (SBUS) need no external inverter.

## Defaults

* Motor protocol DSHOT300, PID loop 1 kHz
* Battery voltage scale 1100 (100k / 10k divider)
* Current scale 100 (10 mV/A, OpenESC 30x30). Change `current_meter_scale` for another ESC
* The 10 V VTX rail is on after boot. The `USER1` mode switches it **off**

## Not supported yet

* Analog OSD (GPIO 4, 5, 6)
* microSD blackbox
* Bidirectional DSHOT, use the ESC telemetry wire instead
* ESC passthrough (BLHeli 4-way interface)
* Dynamic gyro notch, gyro Kalman and adaptive filter
* Servo outputs: the board has none

## Flashing

Hold the BOOT button while plugging in USB, the board shows up as a mass
storage device. Copy `inav_x.y.z_OPENFC_LITE.uf2` onto it.
